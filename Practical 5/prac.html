        <h2>INTRODUCTION</h2>
        <br>
        <p>
            The brain is the most complex part of the human body.
            This three-pound organ is the seat of intelligence, interpreter of the senses, initiator of body movement,
            and controller of behavior. Lying in its bony shell and washed by protective fluid, the brain is the source
            of all the qualities that define our humanity.
            The brain is the crown jewel of the human body.
            For centuries, scientists and philosophers have been fascinated by the brain, but until recently they viewed
            the brain as nearly incomprehensible. Now, however, the brain is beginning to relinquish its secrets.
            Scientists have learned more about the brain in the last 10 years than in all previous centuries because of
            the accelerating pace of research in neurological and behavioral science and the development of new research
            techniques.
            As a result, Congress named the 1990s the Decade of the Brain. At the forefront of research on the brain and
            other elements of the nervous system is the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS),
            which conducts and supports scientific studies in the United States and around the world.

            <h2>The Architecture of the Brain</h2>
            <br>
            <img align="left" src="download (1).jpeg">

            <p>The brain is like a committee of experts. All the parts of the brain work together, but each part has its
                own special properties. The brain can be divided into three basic units: the forebrain, the midbrain,
                and the hindbrain.

                The hindbrain includes the upper part of the spinal cord, the brain stem, and a wrinkled ball of tissue
                called the cerebellum (1). The hindbrain controls the body’s vital functions such as respiration and
                heart rate. The cerebellum coordinates movement and is involved in learned rote movements. When you play
                the piano or hit a tennis ball you are activating the cerebellum. The uppermost part of the brainstem is
                the midbrain, which controls some reflex actions and is part of the circuit involved in the control of
                eye movements and other voluntary movements. The forebrain is the largest and most highly developed part
                of the human brain: it consists primarily of the cerebrum (2) and the structures hidden beneath it (see
                "The Inner Brain").

                When people see pictures of the brain it is usually the cerebrum that they notice. The cerebrum sits at
                the topmost part of the brain and is the source of intellectual activities. It holds your memories,
                allows you to plan, enables you to imagine and think. It allows you to recognize friends, read books,
                and play games.

                The cerebrum is split into two halves (hemispheres) by a deep fissure. Despite the split, the two
                cerebral hemispheres communicate with each other through a thick tract of nerve fibers that lies at the
                base of this fissure. Although the two hemispheres seem to be mirror images of each other, they are
                different. For instance, the ability to form words seems to lie primarily in the left hemisphere, while
                the right hemisphere seems to control many abstract reasoning skills.

                For some as-yet-unknown reason, nearly all of the signals from the brain to the body and vice-versa
                cross over on their way to and from the brain. This means that the right cerebral hemisphere primarily
                controls the left side of the body and the left hemisphere primarily controls the right side. When one
                side of the brain is damaged, the opposite side of the body is affected. For example, a stroke in the
                right hemisphere of the brain can leave the left arm and leg paralyzed.</p>

    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;KNOW MORE ABOUT BRAIN</h3>
    <div class="three">Each cerebral hemisphere can be divided into sections, or lobes, each of which specializes in
        different functions. To understand each lobe and its specialty we will take a tour of the cerebral hemispheres,
        starting with the two frontal lobes (3), which lie directly behind the forehead. When you plan a schedule,
        imagine the future, or use reasoned arguments, these two lobes do much of the work. One of the ways the frontal
        lobes seem to do these things is by acting as short-term storage sites, allowing one idea to be kept in mind
        while other ideas are considered. In the rearmost portion of each frontal lobe is a motor area (4), which helps
        control voluntary movement. A nearby place on the left frontal lobe called Broca’s area (5) allows thoughts to
        be transformed into words.

        When you enjoy a good meal—the taste, aroma, and texture of the food—two sections behind the frontal lobes
        called the parietal lobes (6) are at work. The forward parts of these lobes, just behind the motor areas, are
        the primary sensory areas (7). These areas receive information about temperature, taste, touch, and movement
        from the rest of the body. Reading and arithmetic are also functions in the repertoire of each parietal lobe.

        As you look at the words and pictures on this page, two areas at the back of the brain are at work. These lobes,
        called the occipital lobes (8), process images from the eyes and link that information with images stored in
        memory. Damage to the occipital lobes can cause blindness.

        The last lobes on our tour of the cerebral hemispheres are the temporal lobes (9), which lie in front of the
        visual areas and nest under the parietal and frontal lobes. Whether you appreciate symphonies or rock music,
        your brain responds through the activity of these lobes. At the top of each temporal lobe is an area responsible
        for receiving information from the ears.
        The underside of each temporal lobe plays a crucial role in forming and retrieving memories, including those
        associated with music.
        Other parts of this lobe seem to integrate memories and sensations of taste, sound, sight, and touch.</div>
