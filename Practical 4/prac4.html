        <p style="color: rgb(11, 12, 5);">The United States detonated two nuclear weapons over the Japanese cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki on August 6 and 9, 1945, respectively. 
            The two bombings killed between 129,000 and 226,000 people, most of whom were civilians, and remain the only use of nuclear weapons in armed conflict.

            In the final year of World War II, the Allies prepared for a costly invasion of the Japanese mainland. 
            This undertaking was preceded by a conventional and firebombing campaign that devastated 67 Japanese cities. The war in Europe concluded when Germany surrendered on May 8, 1945, and the Allies turned their full attention to the Pacific War. By July 1945, the Allies' Manhattan Project had produced two types of atomic bombs: "Fat Man", a plutonium implosion-type nuclear weapon; and "Little Boy", an enriched uranium gun-type fission weapon. The 509th Composite Group of the United States Army Air Forces was trained and equipped with the specialized Silverplate version of the Boeing B-29 Superfortress, and deployed to Tinian in the Mariana Islands. The Allies called for the unconditional surrender of the Imperial Japanese armed forces in the Potsdam Declaration on July 26, 1945, the alternative being "prompt and utter destruction". 
            Japan ignored the ultimatum and the war continued.</p>

        <h3 class="Heading" >Quebec Agreement:</h3> 

        <p id="Select">The consent of the United Kingdom was obtained for the bombing, as was required by the Quebec Agreement, and orders were issued on July 25 for atomic bombs to be used against Hiroshima, Kokura, Niigata, and Nagasaki.
            These targets were chosen because they were large urban areas that also held militarily significant facilities. On August 6, a Little Boy was dropped on Hiroshima; three days later, a Fat Man was dropped on Nagasaki. 
            Over the next two to four months, the effects of the atomic bombings killed between 90,000 and 146,000 people in Hiroshima and 39,000 and 80,000 people in Nagasaki; roughly half occurred on the first day. For months afterward, large numbers of people continued to die from the effects of burns, radiation sickness, and injuries, compounded by illness and malnutrition. 
            Most of the dead were civilians, although Hiroshima had a sizable military garrison.</p>

                <li><b>About:</b>
                <ul>
                 <li>On 6th August 1945, a US bomber dropped the uranium fission bomb, codenamed Little Boy, on Hiroshima, a city in Japan.
                 <li>Three days later it dropped another bomb codenamed Fat Man, on Nagasaki.
                <li>The explosion and resultant firestorms are believed to have killed around 80,000 people in Hiroshima and around 40,000 people in Nagasaki.
                <li>Thousands more died in the following years due to the exposure to radiation from the blast and also from the black rain that fell in the aftermath of the explosions.
                <li>Long-term effects of the attack included birth defects, malnutrition, cancer and other illnesses
                <li>This bombing marked the end of World War II, with Japan surrendering to the Allies on 14th August 1945.
                <li>The Allies were one of the two major alliances during World War-II, led by Great Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union.
                <li>The other alliance, Axis was led by Germany, Italy, and Japan.

        <h3 class="Heading"> Aftermath:</h3>  
        
            <li>The attacks were widely criticized around the world for being crimes against humanity.
            <li>Some historians argue the bombings ultimately saved lives by avoiding a land invasion that might have been significantly more deadly.
            <li>The United States has never apologised for the bombings.
            <li>However, in Japan, the attacks are widely regarded as war crimes because they targeted civilians indiscriminately and caused unprecedented destruction.
            <li>After the war, Hiroshima tried to reinvent itself as a City of Peace and continues to promote nuclear disarmament around the world.
            <li>The survivors of this attack are known as â€œHibakusha", many of whom suffered physically and psychologically after the attack.
            <li>Japan's wartime experience has led to a strong pacifist movement in the country. At the annual Hiroshima anniversary, the government usually reconfirms its commitment to a nuclear-free world.
            <li>Japan signed the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons in February 1970.
