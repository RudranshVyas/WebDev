<p ><font size = "+2">Three major forest zones that are separated according to their distance from the equator:</font></p>

<ul>
  <li>These are:</li>
    <ol start = "1" type = "A">
      <li>Tropical</li>
        <ul>
            <li><b>Evergreen: </b>rain year-round, no dry season</li>
            <li><b>Seasonal: </b>vegetation evergreen, short dry season</li>
            <li><b>Dry: </b>long dry season in which trees lose leaves</li>
            <li><b>Montane: </b>most precipitation from mist or fog that rises (also called cloud forests), mostly conifers</li>
            <li><b>Tropical and subtropical coniferous: </b> dry and warm climate with conifers adapted to variable weather            </li>
            <li><b>Sub-tropical: </b>north and south of tropical forests, trees adapted to resist summer drought</li>
        </ul>
      <li>Temperate</li>
        <ul>
          <li><b>Moist conifer and evergreen broad-leaved:</b> mild wet winters and dry summers</li>
          <li><b>Dry conifer:</b> at higher elevations, little rainfall</li>
          <li><b>Mediterranean: </b>located south of temperate regions around coast, almost all trees evergreen</li>
          <li><b>Temperate broad-leaved rainforest: </b>mild, frost-free winters, lots of rain throughout the whole year, evergreen</li>
